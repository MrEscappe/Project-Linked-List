## Projet Linket List - JavaScript

### Description
This project is part of the odin project curriculum. The goal is to implement a linked list in JavaScript. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each element points to the next element in the sequence. It is a linear data structure that is used to store elements. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This project is a good way to practice the concepts of linked lists and to understand how they work.

### Features

- `prepend(value)` Add a new element to the beginning of the list

- `nodeTail()` Return the last element of the list
- `at(index)` Return the element at the given index
- `pop()` Remove the last element from the list and return it 
- `contains(value)` Return true if the list contains the value
- `find(value)` Return the index of the value in the list
